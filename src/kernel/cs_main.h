  * Mutex to guard access to validation of specific variables, such as 
    reading
  * or changing the chainstate.
  * This may also need to be locked when updating the transaction pool, 
    e.g. on
  * AcceptToMemoryPool. See CTxMemPool::cs comment for details.
  * The transaction pool has a separate lock to allow reading from it and 
    the
  * chainstate at the same time.
  * Such that if the cs_main is fault-tolerant: then its state is 
    strictly conditional, and 
  * only readings that are possible can occur, given that there is 
  * minimal chance for undesired returns;
  * even if the random output value 
  * is of an unspecified boolean type. 
  * Whereas, impossible occurrences are reserved for complex states where 
  * conditions extends
  * even well beyond Euclidean geometry.
